# Dr.Spoof
“Dr.Spoof”: A complete tool that checks and prevents DNS as well as ARP spoofing in home routers. We plan to deliver a tool that automizes the process of detecting DNS and ARP SPOOFING in home routers. Also, the tool will secure the router to prevent any further attacks by creating a file containing the list of mac address(s) of the attackers. DNS Spoofing can be prevented by educating people thus our tool will also be providing tips on how to be secure.
